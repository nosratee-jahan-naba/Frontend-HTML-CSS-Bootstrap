<!-- 
<input>
This is an empty input with no type, placeholder, or name. It will default to a plain text box, 
but it's not useful as-is.

<input placeholder="Your First Name">
A text input for the user's first name. It has a placeholder, 
but no type (defaults to text) and no name 
(so the data won't be submitted properly).

<input placeholder="Your Username" required>
A text input for username. 
The required means the user must fill this out before submitting.

<input type="text" placeholder="Your Last name">
A regular text input for the user's last name. Properly typed.

<input type="email" placeholder="Your Email" required>
An input for email addresses. The browser checks if the entered value is a valid email. It's required.

<input type="password" placeholder="Your Password" required>
A password input. The characters are hidden. Also required.

<input type="date">
Lets the user pick a date (usually for birth date or something similar).

<input type="checkbox">
A checkbox. Could be used for "I agree" or newsletter signups,
 but there's no label so the purpose is unclear.

 <input type="radio" name="gender" value="female"> Female
<input type="radio" name="gender" value="male"> Male
These are radio buttons. The user can choose only one option between "female" or "male". The name="gender" groups them together.

<input type="submit">
The submit button that sends the form data when clicked.
